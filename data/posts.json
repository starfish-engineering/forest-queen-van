This material is strong, light, easy to cut, and the t-slot allows for change - which is crucial when you're learning as you build.\n\n## Process Overview\n\nThe construction followed three key steps:\n\n1. **Build the structure** - Create the entire framework from 80/20 aluminum\n2. **Anchor to floor** - Secure the structure using wood as thermal insulation\n3. **Mount panels** - Add veneers to create finished cabinetry\n\nThis approach was heavily influenced by Orton Transit's methodology. The 80/20 floor system is detailed in a separate post: Floor #2.\n\n## Why 80/20?\n\n- **Modularity**: Can reconfigure the layout without starting over\n- **Strength**: Supports heavy systems like batteries and water tanks\n- **Precision**: T-slot system ensures square, aligned builds\n- **Thermal break**: Wood anchors prevent cold transfer from metal floor",

Every decision flowed from this core purpose.\n\n## Four Core Objectives\n\n### 1. Stealth\nThe design avoids obvious recreational vehicle characteristics. No external racks, no visible RV features. The goal: blend into urban environments seamlessly.\n\n### 2. Full-Time Habitation  \nThe space needed to support:\n- Remote work activities\n- Three daily meals (full meal preparation)\n- General daily living requirements\n- Comfortable long-term occupancy\n\n### 3. Year-Round Climate Control\nIntegrated systems for:\n- Heating (Webasto propane heater)\n- Ventilation (MaxxAir fan, windows)\n- Cooling (air conditioning)\n- Insulation (Thinsulate throughout)\n\n### 4. Activity Support\nThe interior accommodates gear for:\n- Mountain biking\n- Snowboarding  \n- Climbing\n- Surfing\n- Onewheel transportation\n\n## Design Development Process\n\nI employed a four-stage prototyping methodology:\n\n### 1. 3D Modeling\nUsed SketchUp software to explore layout variations and material options without physical commitment. This allowed rapid iteration and visualization.\n\n### 2. Physical Mockup\nTape-based spatial layout testing in the empty van. This revealed crucial insights:\n- **Rejected:** Fixed shower compartments\n- **Rejected:** Internal dividing walls\n- **Embraced:** Open, flexible layout\n\n### 3. Component Arrangement  \nLayout planning after ordering parts, ensuring everything fit correctly before permanent installation.\n\n### 4. Framework Construction\nStructural building using 80/20 aluminum (detailed in separate Framing post).\n\n## Key Philosophy\n\n**Start with why, then how.** Understanding the purpose drove every technical decision. This wasn't a weekend warrior van - it needed to be a legitimate home.",

Floor #1 achieved insulation and flatness but lacked structural support - walls were bearing too much load despite being curved and hollow at counter height.\n\n## Design Inspiration\n\nThis approach was inspired by Orton Transit's floor design. The result: warmth, flatness, and the capability to securely anchor or quickly remove interior cabinet modules.\n\n## The 10-Layer System\n\n(Bottom to top)\n\n### 1. Microfoam Corrugation Fillers\nRetained from Floor #1, filling gaps in the van's metal floor corrugations.\n\n### 2. Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV)\nThree-strip layout with offset seams for:\n- Dampening road noise\n- Providing a stable plywood base\n\n### 3. Birch Plywood Floor\nFour sections from 4×8 sheets of 1/2\" material, primer-painted for moisture protection.\n\n### 4. 80/20 Aluminum Structure Base\nThe game-changer:\n- Secured via elevator bolts with construction adhesive\n- Anchored to studs beneath the plywood\n- Plywood anchored to D-ring tie-downs using custom aluminum blocks\n- Creates independent structural grid\n\n### 5. Polyiso Rigid Foam Insulation  \nFills gaps in the 80/20 grid:\n- Creates even thickness\n- Embedded t-slots remain accessible for cabinet anchoring\n- R-value insulation from cold metal floor\n\n### 6. Flooring Materials\n- **Vinyl plank** in walkway areas (wood appearance)\n- **Coin pattern rubber** in side areas (taped down)\n\n### 7. Fiberglass Layer\nAdded down the center walkway for additional durability.\n\n### 8. Heated Floor Pad\nElectric heating pad for cold weather comfort.\n\n### 9. Final Vinyl Plank Layer  \nThe topmost surface - durable, water-resistant, easy to clean.\n\n### 10. 80/20 Cabinetry\nBolted down to open t-slots in the floor structure. Can be reconfigured or removed entirely.\n\n## Key Design Principles\n\n**Independent Structure:** The floor provides structural support independent of the curved, hollow walls.\n\n**Thermal Break:** Multiple insulation layers and wood anchors prevent cold transfer from the metal van floor.\n\n**Modularity:** The 80/20 system allows complete reconfiguration of the interior without rebuilding.\n\n**Serviceability:** Systems beneath the floor (electrical, plumbing) remain accessible.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis floor system transformed the build. Instead of permanent cabinetry screwed into weak walls, everything mounts to a solid, configurable platform. When I wanted to add the butcher block extension or reposition storage, I just unbolted and moved things around.\n\n**Cost:** Approximately $1,500 for materials (80/20, insulation, flooring, MLV)",

    "content": "## Total Investment: $30,500\n\nHere's the complete, honest breakdown of every dollar spent on this build. Transparency helps aspiring van builders plan realistically.\n\n## Top Expenses\n\nThe Pareto principle applies to costs too - a few categories represent the majority of spending:\n\n1. **80/20 Framing:** $5,500 (18%)\n2. **Batteries:** $4,000 (13%)\n3. **Wood Paneling:** $3,000 (10%)\n4. **Slats & Lights:** $2,000 (7%)\n5. **Inverter:** $1,300 (4%)\n\nThese five items total $15,800 - over half the entire build cost.\n\n## Why These Costs?\n\n**80/20 Aluminum:** Expensive but worth it. The modularity and strength justify the cost. Alternatives (wood framing) save money but sacrifice flexibility.\n\n**Batteries:** Battle Born LiFePO4 batteries are premium, but they'll last 10+ years with 3000+ cycles. Cheaper lead-acid batteries would need replacement in 2-3 years.\n\n**Wood Paneling:** I splurged on birch plywood for aesthetics. Could have saved $1,000+ with cheaper materials.\n\n## Where I Saved Money\n\n- **DIY Labor:** Doing all work myself saved $20,000-40,000 in professional conversion costs\n- **Used Tools:** Borrowed or bought used tools when possible\n- **Patient Purchasing:** Watched for sales and deals over 2+ years\n- **Simplified Systems:** No fixed shower, no permanent toilet room\n\n## Where I'd Spend Differently\n\n**Would Spend More:**\n- Better insulation in floor (upgrade to spray foam)\n- Professional electrical inspection for peace of mind\n\n**Would Spend Less:**  \n- Bought too much 80/20 aluminum (overestimated needs)\n- Ordered excess poplar for slats (204 sq ft, needed ~100 sq ft)\n\n## Cost Comparison\n\n**Similar Professional Builds:** $60,000 - $120,000\n\n**My Build:** $30,500 (materials only)\n\n**Time Investment:** ~400 hours of labor\n\nIf you value your time at $50/hour, add $20,000 in labor, bringing total \"cost\" to $50,500 - still cheaper than professional builds and with complete customization.\n\nSee the full detailed breakdown on the Costs page.",
