This material is strong, light, easy to cut, and the t-slot allows for change - which is crucial when you're learning as you build.\n\n## Process Overview\n\nThe construction followed three key steps:\n\n1. **Build the structure** - Create the entire framework from 80/20 aluminum\n2. **Anchor to floor** - Secure the structure using wood as thermal insulation\n3. **Mount panels** - Add veneers to create finished cabinetry\n\nThis approach was heavily influenced by Orton Transit's methodology. The 80/20 floor system is detailed in a separate post: Floor #2.\n\n## Why 80/20?\n\n- **Modularity**: Can reconfigure the layout without starting over\n- **Strength**: Supports heavy systems like batteries and water tanks\n- **Precision**: T-slot system ensures square, aligned builds\n- **Thermal break**: Wood anchors prevent cold transfer from metal floor",

Every decision flowed from this core purpose.\n\n## Four Core Objectives\n\n### 1. Stealth\nThe design avoids obvious recreational vehicle characteristics. No external racks, no visible RV features. The goal: blend into urban environments seamlessly.\n\n### 2. Full-Time Habitation  \nThe space needed to support:\n- Remote work activities\n- Three daily meals (full meal preparation)\n- General daily living requirements\n- Comfortable long-term occupancy\n\n### 3. Year-Round Climate Control\nIntegrated systems for:\n- Heating (Webasto propane heater)\n- Ventilation (MaxxAir fan, windows)\n- Cooling (air conditioning)\n- Insulation (Thinsulate throughout)\n\n### 4. Activity Support\nThe interior accommodates gear for:\n- Mountain biking\n- Snowboarding  \n- Climbing\n- Surfing\n- Onewheel transportation\n\n## Design Development Process\n\nI employed a four-stage prototyping methodology:\n\n### 1. 3D Modeling\nUsed SketchUp software to explore layout variations and material options without physical commitment. This allowed rapid iteration and visualization.\n\n### 2. Physical Mockup\nTape-based spatial layout testing in the empty van. This revealed crucial insights:\n- **Rejected:** Fixed shower compartments\n- **Rejected:** Internal dividing walls\n- **Embraced:** Open, flexible layout\n\n### 3. Component Arrangement  \nLayout planning after ordering parts, ensuring everything fit correctly before permanent installation.\n\n### 4. Framework Construction\nStructural building using 80/20 aluminum (detailed in separate Framing post).\n\n## Key Philosophy\n\n**Start with why, then how.** Understanding the purpose drove every technical decision. This wasn't a weekend warrior van - it needed to be a legitimate home.",

Floor #1 achieved insulation and flatness but lacked structural support - walls were bearing too much load despite being curved and hollow at counter height.\n\n## Design Inspiration\n\nThis approach was inspired by Orton Transit's floor design. The result: warmth, flatness, and the capability to securely anchor or quickly remove interior cabinet modules.\n\n## The 10-Layer System\n\n(Bottom to top)\n\n### 1. Microfoam Corrugation Fillers\nRetained from Floor #1, filling gaps in the van's metal floor corrugations.\n\n### 2. Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV)\nThree-strip layout with offset seams for:\n- Dampening road noise\n- Providing a stable plywood base\n\n### 3. Birch Plywood Floor\nFour sections from 4×8 sheets of 1/2\" material, primer-painted for moisture protection.\n\n### 4. 80/20 Aluminum Structure Base\nThe game-changer:\n- Secured via elevator bolts with construction adhesive\n- Anchored to studs beneath the plywood\n- Plywood anchored to D-ring tie-downs using custom aluminum blocks\n- Creates independent structural grid\n\n### 5. Polyiso Rigid Foam Insulation  \nFills gaps in the 80/20 grid:\n- Creates even thickness\n- Embedded t-slots remain accessible for cabinet anchoring\n- R-value insulation from cold metal floor\n\n### 6. Flooring Materials\n- **Vinyl plank** in walkway areas (wood appearance)\n- **Coin pattern rubber** in side areas (taped down)\n\n### 7. Fiberglass Layer\nAdded down the center walkway for additional durability.\n\n### 8. Heated Floor Pad\nElectric heating pad for cold weather comfort.\n\n### 9. Final Vinyl Plank Layer  \nThe topmost surface - durable, water-resistant, easy to clean.\n\n### 10. 80/20 Cabinetry\nBolted down to open t-slots in the floor structure. Can be reconfigured or removed entirely.\n\n## Key Design Principles\n\n**Independent Structure:** The floor provides structural support independent of the curved, hollow walls.\n\n**Thermal Break:** Multiple insulation layers and wood anchors prevent cold transfer from the metal van floor.\n\n**Modularity:** The 80/20 system allows complete reconfiguration of the interior without rebuilding.\n\n**Serviceability:** Systems beneath the floor (electrical, plumbing) remain accessible.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis floor system transformed the build. Instead of permanent cabinetry screwed into weak walls, everything mounts to a solid, configurable platform. When I wanted to add the butcher block extension or reposition storage, I just unbolted and moved things around.\n\n**Cost:** Approximately $1,500 for materials (80/20, insulation, flooring, MLV)",

    "content": "## Total Investment: $30,500\n\nHere's the complete, honest breakdown of every dollar spent on this build. Transparency helps aspiring van builders plan realistically.\n\n## Top Expenses\n\nThe Pareto principle applies to costs too - a few categories represent the majority of spending:\n\n1. **80/20 Framing:** $5,500 (18%)\n2. **Batteries:** $4,000 (13%)\n3. **Wood Paneling:** $3,000 (10%)\n4. **Slats & Lights:** $2,000 (7%)\n5. **Inverter:** $1,300 (4%)\n\nThese five items total $15,800 - over half the entire build cost.\n\n## Why These Costs?\n\n**80/20 Aluminum:** Expensive but worth it. The modularity and strength justify the cost. Alternatives (wood framing) save money but sacrifice flexibility.\n\n**Batteries:** Battle Born LiFePO4 batteries are premium, but they'll last 10+ years with 3000+ cycles. Cheaper lead-acid batteries would need replacement in 2-3 years.\n\n**Wood Paneling:** I splurged on birch plywood for aesthetics. Could have saved $1,000+ with cheaper materials.\n\n## Where I Saved Money\n\n- **DIY Labor:** Doing all work myself saved $20,000-40,000 in professional conversion costs\n- **Used Tools:** Borrowed or bought used tools when possible\n- **Patient Purchasing:** Watched for sales and deals over 2+ years\n- **Simplified Systems:** No fixed shower, no permanent toilet room\n\n## Where I'd Spend Differently\n\n**Would Spend More:**\n- Better insulation in floor (upgrade to spray foam)\n- Professional electrical inspection for peace of mind\n\n**Would Spend Less:**  \n- Bought too much 80/20 aluminum (overestimated needs)\n- Ordered excess poplar for slats (204 sq ft, needed ~100 sq ft)\n\n## Cost Comparison\n\n**Similar Professional Builds:** $60,000 - $120,000\n\n**My Build:** $30,500 (materials only)\n\n**Time Investment:** ~400 hours of labor\n\nIf you value your time at $50/hour, add $20,000 in labor, bringing total \"cost\" to $50,500 - still cheaper than professional builds and with complete customization.\n\nSee the full detailed breakdown on the Costs page.",

    "content": "## Living Green Space\n\nEver since the skylight was installed, it seemed only natural to bring real plants into the build to soak up the solar rays.\n\nMy dear friend Maria helped me build and plant this garden. The combination of natural light from the skylight and proper drainage creates a thriving indoor garden space.\n\n## What's Growing\n\n- Succulents for low-maintenance greenery\n- Herbs for cooking (basil, mint, thyme)\n- Air-purifying plants\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Air Quality:** Plants naturally filter and freshen the air\n- **Mental Health:** Greenery reduces stress and increases happiness  \n- **Functionality:** Fresh herbs for cooking\n- **Aesthetics:** The garden is a stunning focal point\n\n## Design Details\n\nThe garden bed was custom-built to fit beneath the skylight, with proper drainage to prevent water damage. It's secured to the 80/20 frame and can be removed if needed.\n\nThis might be my favorite feature of the entire build.",
