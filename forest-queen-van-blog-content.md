**Author:** Shaun Robinson

### Main Content

This post describes Robinson's approach to constructing the van's interior framework using 80/20 extruded t-slot aluminum. He praises the material for being "strong, light, easy to cut, and the t-slot allows for change."

### Process Overview

The construction methodology followed three key steps:

1. Build the entire structure from 80/20 aluminum framing
2. Anchor the 80/20 structure to the floor using wood as thermal insulation
3. Mount panels as veneers to create finished cabinetry

Robinson references Orton Transit as an influence on this building approach.

### Additional Information

## 10. Design & Layout
**Published:** July 31, 2022
**Modified:** November 27, 2022
**Author:** Shaun Robinson

### Main Content

The article describes the design process for a DIY van conversion project. The author outlines the planning phase for a vehicle intended as a full-time mobile home for over one year while traveling the western North American coast.

### Core Objectives

The project prioritized four main goals:

1. **Stealth** – The design aimed to avoid obvious recreational vehicle characteristics, excluding external racks or visible RV features to blend into urban environments.

2. **Full-time habitation** – The space needed to accommodate work activities, meal preparation (three daily meals), and general living requirements.

3. **Year-round climate control** – The build incorporated heating, ventilation, cooling, and insulation systems.

4. **Activity support** – The interior was designed to accommodate mountain biking, snowboarding, climbing, surfing, and onewheel transportation gear.

### Design Development Process

The author employed a four-stage prototyping methodology:

- **3D modeling:** SketchUp software was used to explore layout variations and material options without physical commitment.
- **Physical mockup:** Tape-based spatial layout testing revealed preferences, specifically rejecting fixed shower compartments or internal walls.
- **Component arrangement:** Layout planning after ordering parts.
- **Framework construction:** Structural building (detailed separately in additional documentation).

### Visual Content

The post includes approximately 12 images showing various stages of the build process, from sketches and prototype mockups to framing and construction phases.

## 11. Electrical
**Published:** July 31, 2022
**Modified:** November 27, 2022
**Author:** Shaun Robinson

### Main Content

The post describes building a comprehensive electrical system for the camper van. The author emphasizes that "the power system is the key, central feature of the van's mobility."

### Power Consumption Analysis

Following the Pareto principle, the system prioritizes the devices consuming the most energy:

- Water heater: 1500W (AC)
- Air conditioning: 300W (AC)
- Laptop: 100W (AC)
- Miscellaneous devices (fan, toilet, lights): 100W (DC)

### Power Generation Sources

The van includes three charging methods:

- Car alternator (while driving)
- Solar panels
- Shore power connection

The author notes that Victron MultiPlus inverters provide both charging capability and automatic transfer switching between battery and shore power.

### Energy Storage

The system uses "4 x 100Ah LiFePO4 Batteries" for power storage.

### Electrical Specifications

**Wire sizing throughout the system:**

- Battery-to-battery ground: 4/0 AWG welding cable
- Battery-to-inverter: 3/0 AWG welding cable
- Inverter-to-AC distribution: 6/3 cable
- Inverter-to-DC distribution: #2 AWG
- AC outlets: 12/3 (20A) or 14/3 (15A)
- DC appliances: 18AWG–12AWG

### Images

Twenty-three photographs document the installation process, showing battery banks, wiring configurations, distribution panels, and completed electrical components throughout the van.

## 12. Floor #2
**Published:** July 31, 2022
**Modified:** November 27, 2022
**Author:** Shaun Robinson

### Introduction

The article describes the construction of the van's floor system, which the author considers "the base of the build and provides the features for the rest of the build." The author notes that Floor #1 achieved insulation and flatness but lacked structural support, requiring walls to bear much of the load despite being curved and hollow at counter height.

### Design Approach

The construction methodology drew inspiration from "Orton Transit - Floor" website. The resulting floor provides warmth, flatness, and the capability to securely anchor or quickly remove interior cabinet modules.

### The Multi-Layer Floor System

The author humorously refers to the floor as a "7-Layer Burrito" but actually describes 10 distinct layers (bottom to top):

1. **Microfoam corrugation fillers** — Retained from Floor #1, filling gaps in the van's metal floor
2. **Mass Loaded Vinyl (MLV)** — Three-strip layout with offset seams for dampening road noise and providing a plywood base
3. **Birch plywood floor** — Four sections from 4x8 sheets of 1/2" material, primer-painted
4. **80/20 aluminum structure base** — Secured via elevator bolts with construction adhesive to studs anchored beneath the plywood; plywood anchored to D-ring tie-downs using custom aluminum blocks
5. **Polyiso rigid foam insulation** — Fills 80/20 gaps, creating even thickness with embedded t-slots for cabinet anchoring
6. **Flooring materials** — Vinyl plank in walkway areas; coin pattern rubber in side areas (taped down)
7. **Fiberglass layer** — Added down the center walkway
8. **Heated floor pad** — Installed on top
9. **Final vinyl plank layer** — The topmost surface
10. **80/20 cabinetry** — Bolted down to open t-slots

### Key Design Principles

The floor system addresses structural limitations of the curved, hollow walls by providing an independent support structure. The use of 80/20 aluminum framing allows flexible reconfiguration of interior modules while maintaining structural integrity.

### Visual Documentation

The post includes 28 photographs documenting the construction process, showing various stages of floor assembly, layering, and integration with the surrounding van structure.
